# App Center

To get started with App Center's command line tool, run this command in your terminal:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL http://bit.ly/2nOapms)"
```

For the extra-cautious, here's the same without the shortened URL:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MobileCenter/mobile-center-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh)"
```
